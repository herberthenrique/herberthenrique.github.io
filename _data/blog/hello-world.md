  Hi 👋


  My name is Herbert and I try to write code for humans for more than 10 years now. 👨‍💻

  Every day, in some way, I'm helping people and solving problems.


  That's why I work as Engineer Manager at [@SumUp](https://twitter.com/sumupeng), empowering small businesses across the world.


  Also, I love javascript, functional programming and terrible jokes 🤷‍♂️
