  Six reasons why my team decided to use golang as our main programming language

Hi! My name is Herbert and I'm a software engineer at [@SumUp](https://twitter.com/sumupeng). We're a multi-language company and this means we use **a lot** of languages in our ecosystem. Just to mentions a few of them, we have: Golang, Ruby, Elixir, Erlang, Javascript (node, react), Swift, Kotlin and Java.

_If you understand portuguese, [we have a podcast](https://hipsters.tech/hardware-multiplas-linguagens-e-microsservicos-na-sumup-hipsters-on-the-road-30/) about how we deal with hardware, multi-languages, and microservices at Sumup_

But, my team was working a lot with ruby for more than one year. When the time of creating a new microservice came, we had to decide if we keep using ruby or we change to a new language. Even with all these languages in our ecosystem, we don't choose to change languages because we have a brand new amazing language in the community, but because this can solve our problems and this can help our customers to grow.

These are the reasons why we choose Golang (therefore dropping ruby) between all the options we had.

# 1 - Hiring

This is one of our main priorities since SumUp is a hyper-growth company that is doubling the size of engineers every year,
We need to choose a language that people want to use and it’s much simpler to onboard engineers that have never seen the code before, getting them productive early with Go.

Go was between the most loved and wanted languages in the [Stack Overflow Survey 2019](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) and this means we can have an idea that new engineers would like to work with this language.

# 2 - Easy to learn, to be productive and to deliver value

Go is one of the easiest languages to learn, with only [25 keywords](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Keywords). The docs are good and we can find great material like [A tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) that makes your learning curve less steep.

Our developers had a lot of experience with the Object-Oriented Paradigm and a change to functional programming would cause a learning curve even bigger for the team (in case we had chosen Elixir).

Go is very explicit, focusing on making exactly what’s going on very clear. There is no magic, no implicitness.

In this point, I really loved the team super happy to learn a new language, we even host a Go Meetup in São Paulo to talk about was going our experience with go.

# 3 - It’s a compiled, statically typed language.

I'll tell you a secret if don't work today with a typed language today: You're gonna love it or hate it.

In case you hate, you will only be able to see the biggest benefits of working with one in a new codebase or after some time.

In the end, software's biggest cost lives in maintaining and not in the time you spent creating the code. Typed languages will help you a lot to find out how the software is working.

statically types will also help you to find out about errors in the early stage of the development process.

Static typing usually results in compiled code that executes quickly. The compiler knows the exact data types that are in use, it can produce optimized machine code.

# 4 - The Tooling around helps you and it's opinionated

If you install Go, you'll have already lint, format, and test tools.

Using `gofmt` or `goimports` in your code you'll have out the box all the settings and best practices adopted by the community.
You can go a little further with more restrictive rules, I personally made this for a few projects and in the end was learning even more how to properly use the language.
Go is super opinionated by default with code style and you don't need to waste time arguing with your team about small details, you just need to follow what is already defined.

Go also comes with a test framework, so you have all the basic to already create a good and maintainable software without having to worry too much or choose frameworks.

# 5 - We want to have a common language in our squads/tribe

We work with the concept of squads and tribes as per [The Spotify Tribe Engineering Model](https://medium.com/scaled-agile-framework/exploring-key-elements-of-spotifys-agile-scaling-model-471d2a23d7ea) and my squad was inside a tribe that has many programming languages. We wanted to have a common language that all our squads could use, this means that any engineer can switch the squad she's working and start to deliver value super fast. I know, this is a little bit against being a multilanguage company, but in our tribe we do see that as the main benefit of using Go as our main language.

This is really good for the company, but also for developers who want to change the current context a little or maybe live in another country.
Our tribe has squads in two locations, Berlin and São Paulo. If someone wants to move and continue working in the tribe, they won’t have technological issues
We had some of these experiences of a software engineer who had [a life between two continents](https://medium.com/inside-sumup/life-as-a-sumup-software-engineer-across-2-continents-c64e626eeee7).

# 6 - No Silver Bullet

Go will never be our [silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet) and we don't expect this from this language or any other.
And you shouldn't expect this from any technology.

Go demonstrated to be a good solution for our next project and became the first answer when we thought what is going to be the language of other projects, but this will never mean that Go will be the solution for everything.

And we're happy with this, we need to also have space to create new things and find the right tools for the job.

## Bonus reason - Amazing mascot, great packages names.

Did you see their mascot? You can even have [your own gopher](https://gopherize.me/)!
Go also has incredible libraries names like [Gin Gonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin), [Gorilla](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/) or [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io/en/)?

### Are you using Go in your company or intent to use?

How is your experience with Go? Are you enjoying work or learn this language? Send me a tweet and tell me your experience at [@herberth3nrique](https://twitter.com/herberth3nrique).

I hope you liked the reasons I showed to you, I tried to focus on what are the benefits that the language bring to my team, so I try to not mention the most common benefits of the language like Concurrency, Cross-Platform, Performance and Garbage collection.

Don't forget to share on twitter :)
